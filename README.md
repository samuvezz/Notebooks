These are a few codes I have used during my studies and my professional experience as teaching assistant

Welcome to my little corner of the coding world, where scraping and statistics meet in a digital dance of data! This GitHub repository is home to some 
of the most interesting and exciting projects I've tackled during my studies, mainly focused on webscraping and statistical analyses. 
Here, you'll find scripts that can extract, clean and transform large datasets from the web as well as statistical models that can help you make sense of complex data. 

Please, in case you are interested in my thesis research use the "df" csv file.
